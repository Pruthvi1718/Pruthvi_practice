QUESTION 1:
User function Template for python3
a = input()
b = input()
separator = input()[0]
########### Write your code below ###############
# Print with space
# Print without newline at the end
# Print with separator
# Print without space
########### Write your code above ###############

SOLUTION:
print(a+" "+b)
print(a,b,end="")
print(a+separator+b)
print(a+b)


QUESTION 2:
Examples:
Input: a = "Hello", n = 5
Output: HelloHelloHelloHelloHello
Explanation: a is printed n=5 times in a single line without space between them.

SOLUTION:
a = input()
n = int(input())
#code here

for i in range(n):
    print(a, end="")


QUESTION 3:
Examples:
Input: a = 6, b = 4, c = &
Output: 666666&4444
Explanation: 6 printed 6 times and 4 printed 4 times separated by c = &.

SOLUTION:
#User function Template for python3
a = input()
b = input()
c = input()
# Write your code below that prints a a times and b b times, separated by c
print(int(a)*a + c + int(b)*b)


QUESTION 4:
Input: s = "Hello", n = 20, f = 5.5
Output:
Hello
30
55.0
Explanation:
The string Hello is printed as it is.
The integer 20 is increased by 10 and results in 30.
The floating-point number 5.5 is multiplied by 10 and results in 55.0.

SOLUTION:
s = input()
n = int(input())
f = float(input())

print(s)
print(n + 10)
print(f * 10)
