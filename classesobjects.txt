CLASS:
Class is A class in Python is a blueprint or template used to create objects.
It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that describe the
properties and behaviors of an object.

Example:
Think of a class as a blueprint of a car, and
objects are the actual cars built from the blueprint.

Class has 3 components:

(a) Attributes
Variables belonging to the class

Two types:
Instance Attributes - Unique to each object
class Demo:
    def message(self):
        print("This is an instance method")

Class Attributes - Shared by all objects

(b) Method:
Method is a function in class

(c) Constructor:
Constructor (__init__)
A special method that runs automatically when an object is created
Used for initializing attributes

example:
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name   #attribute
        self.age = age

    def show(self):        #method used
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}")

s1 = Student("Rocky", 22)  #object created
s1.show()

REAL TIME Example:
class Doctor:
    def __init__(self, name, specialization):
        self.name = name
        self.specialization = specialization

    def show_details(self):
        print(f"Dr. {self.name} - {self.specialization}")
d1 = Doctor("Adi", "Cardiologist")
d1.show_details()

Uses:
Supports oops concepts
Well organized code
object, methods used




INHERITANCE:
Inheritance in Python is an OOP concept where a child class
(derived class) can acquire properties and methods of a parent class (base class).

Syntax:
class Parent:
    # Parent properties & methods

class Child(Parent):
    # Child extends Parent

Example:
class Dog:
    def sound(self):
        print("Bark")

class Cat:
    def sound(self):
        print("Meow")

for animal in (Dog(), Cat()):
    animal.sound()

Types: -single Inheritance - 1 parent class & 1 child class
       -multiple Inheritance - 2 parent class & 1 child class
       -multilevel Inheritance - 1 Grand parent class, 1 parent class, 1 child class
       -Hierarchical inheritance - 1 parent class & 2 child class

Uses:
Avoid duplication
Easy maintenance
Reusability
Polymorphism
