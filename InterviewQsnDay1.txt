1. var, let, const
var:- var is function-scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned
      it is oldest function scoped variable declaration
      it is function scope not block scope
      var is risky bcz it will ignore the blocks, it not good behavior

example:
if(true)
{
    var x = 5;
}
console.log(x);  op is 5

: variable declaration
var x = 10;
console.log(x); op is 10

: declared but undefined situation
console.log(x);
var x = 20; op is undefined


let:- let is block scoped, safer than var
      let can be reassigned but not redeclared

example:
let x = 10;
console.log(x); op is 10

if (true)
{
    let x =10;
}
console.log(x); op x will not defined

in let TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)
TDZ:- TDZ means the variable exists but cannot be accessed before its declaration

console.log(y);
y = 15;   TDZ


const:- const is block scoped, but can not be reassigned

example:
const user = {
    name:"ABC"
};
console.log(user); op is ABC

const user = {
    name: "ABC"
};

user.name = "DEF";
console.log(user); op is DEF

combination of let and const:-
const GST = 18;

let price = 1000;
let total = price + (price * GST / 100);
console.log(total);

var a = 1;
let b = 2;
const c = 3;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);



2. HOISTING
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their
containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed

examples:-
greet();

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!")
}   op is Hello!


var a = 1;
let b = 2;
const c = 3;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);

function demo() {
    console.log(a);
    var a = 30;

    function a() {
        console.log("Hi");
    }
    console.log(a);
}
demo();



3. == and === (Equality, StrictEquality)
